At my day job, i had to run firefox as a kiosk application on RPi3. In this blog post, i will note down the steps that i did so that i or my team members can refer to it when needed.

I have not used any display manager or Desktop Environment but had to use matchbox-window-manager to make firefox run on full screen.
- *sudo apt-get install vim* (this is just for me, i can't help it)
	- *sudo apt-get install xorg xutils matchbox-window-manager *
	- *sudo apt-get install iceweasel* (this is firefox :p)
	- *sudo raspi-config*
- Go to boot options and setup auto login for user pi
	- Change the keyboard layout if you wish to
- As a sudo user, do the following steps:
- *cp -r /home/pi  /opt/*
	- *cd /opt/pi*
	- *chmod -R a+r .*
	- *touch .xsessionrc*
	- *chmod a+x .xsessionrc*
- Open .xsessionrc as a sudo user and put the following lines there:
- *xset s off # no screen saver*
*xset -dpms  # disable some power consumption thingy*
*xset s noblank # don't blank the rpi screen*
*matchbox-window-manager &*
*while true; do*
*  firefox --url http://127.0.0.1*
*done*
- Copy *.xsessionrc* file to */home/pi/ *
- *cp .xsessionrc /home/pi*
- Configure *.bash_profile* to start X server when user logs in:
- *if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ] && [ -n "$XDG_VTNR" ] && [ "$XDG_VTNR" -eq 1 ]; then*
* exec startx*
*fi*
- Install an extension in firefox to apply kiosk mode. The first extension that comes up when you search kiosk in addons works fine
